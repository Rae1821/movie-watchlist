## Overview

### The challenge

This was commpleted as one of the solo projects for the Scrimba Working with APIs class. 
The solo projects are projects that you complete on your own, there is no tutorial walking you through how to code the project.

The requirements for this project included:
  - Two pages - index.html and watchlist.html
  - Index = search page. Calls to OMDB API with the title searched for and displays search results
  - Button to "add to watchlist" which saves that data to local storage
  - Watchlist.html loads and displays data from local storage

In addition to meeting the requirements I also:
  - Added a button to switch from light to dark mode and vice versa
  - Used media queries to make it responsive and look good on all screen sizes
  - Added my own google fonts and a different background photo for the header
  - Added a cute sloth image when the watchlist is empty
